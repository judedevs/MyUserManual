# My User Manual
## Conditions I like to work in
Generally I am quite adaptable and I've worked and thrived in a lot of different environments before. For me the below is an ideal working environment in which I find it easy to be productive and happy.

- I work well in practical environments where decision making is objective and impersonal. I detest process for the sake of process but have learned to work within it in more corporate environments. 
- I prefer working with people who are organised and consistent and make sure to also extend that courtesy to people who need to work with me.
- I like to be able to select the best solution for the problem at hand rather than to be forced into a particular way of doing because of dogmatic adherence to a particular methodology. I love debating these solutions with team mates where necessary and will readily give up my own position if enough facts are presented to show that there is a better way.
- I like to work within a collaborative team but I do find meetings and calls more draining so I prefer to do these first thing in the morning. This way I can focus on coding in the afternoon and carve out time for deep work without interruption.
- I expect people to bring facts to an argument and will normally withdraw or push back too hard if the discussion becomes emotionally charged or unproductive.
- I am open to pairing on difficult problems and I like having a good group solutioneering session before starting a bigger piece of work to make sure we implement the best solution. I do, however, also really value being able to work on my own and get into a flow state when I need to.

## Hours I like to keep
- I tend to be flexible around working hours. Coming from an always online situation I am still finding what healthy looks like for me.
- I ideally like to get a workout in before work so I will usually start work between 8AM and 9AM.
- I try and prioritise any admin or meetings in the morning and then focus on deep work in the afternoon.
- I am trying to be better about switching off after 6PM but if I am in flow I will often be online later.
- I am used to being on pager duty but prefer this to be a fairly shared load and planned in advance so I can also make time for my family and other commitments.

## Best ways to communicate with me
- I prefer asynchronous communication like Slack where possible but I am happy to jump on a call if it is more efficient. Just give me a heads up - my inner millenial still does not do well with surprise calls.
- I check emails but I prefer to keep these for more formal communication. They are not really an efficient way to get quick information out of me. If you need something on a paper trail best is to mention that on the Slack chat while talking to me and I will summarise and send with the appropriate CC's.
- I have become quite adept at context-switching so I am very responsive on Slack and will need to put myself on do not disturb if I really need to focus on something. This is more for my own discipline than to discourage communication. Please reach out and I will respond as soon as I can.
- I prefer direct and to the point communication and in this can sometimes come across as blunt. I have been made duly aware of this in the past and I am always happy for anyone to call me out on it if it is not helpful.

## How I best receive feedback
- I prefer feedback to be given in a direct and constructive manner. I am always looking to improve and I appreciate feedback that is actionable and specific.
- I struggle when people sentimentalise issues and prefer to get to the point quickly. I might come across as dismissive of feedback if it is too emotionally laden because I struggle to process it and make it actionable.
- I prefer constructive feedback in a one-on-one setting where we can talk calmly and openly.

## How I learn best
- I learn best by doing. I will read the documentation, watch a Youtube video or two and then I need to implement.
- I also learn from casual conversations with team mates so I appreciate it when people are open to discussing problems and solutions with me.

## Things I struggle with
- I am very action-oriented and can be a total "fixer". This can make me a poor venting buddy. I am working on this in my personal life but at work I tend to steer conversations towards solutions rather than just listening.
- I do not tolerate negative and condenscending behaviour well in a team setting. I expect people to be respectful and focussed on solving problems rather than stating them all the time.
- Chaotic meetings or environments where everyone is talking at once and we are not getting to the point. These are really overstimulating and frustrating for me.
- Long calls - I struggle not to go into idle mode or switch off eventually.


## Things I love
- I really love building software and solving problems. I am at my best when I am challenged intellectually and can see the impact of my work.
- I love working with people who are passionate about what they do and who are open to learning and growing.
- I love learning new things and chatting about new technologies and ideas, especially over a coffee or a beer.
- When I am not coding I love to be outdoors - running or hiking.
- Cats. I love cats.
